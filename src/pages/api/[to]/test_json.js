The country has the highest case and fatality figures in the world. From March 2020, stay-at-home lockdown began to be implemented as the virus spread across the country. All states began reopening as of June 2020 at widely varying paces, before reimposing restrictions from October 2020, and then moving once more to lift most remaining measures as of April 2021 while implementing vaccination campaigns.
